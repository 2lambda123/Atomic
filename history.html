        <p> Consider these changelists, if you can</p>

    <h2>Version 1.19</h2>
    <p><em>Released October 31, 2014</em></p>
    <ul>
		<li>Slight performance tweaks. <p>These performance tweaks might not always
		be visible, but I've been trying to optimize the prebase. I'm fairly happy
		with where it's gone so far, but it's by far not perfect. </p> </li>
		<li>I ran Astyle over the whole tree to try and make it look more "regliar"
		in terms of form. This had the effect of revealing some nasty bugs that I
		hadn't seen until that point.</li>
		<li>Nick matching now ignores mIRC colors. This means you can be highlighted in
		a bunch of different colors and you'll still get a ping prompt for it.</li>
		<li>Message formatting got some upgrades.</li>
		<li>Ident is now called Username. This makes more sense and fits more in
		line with other IRC clients, as well as bouncer configuration.</li>
		<li>There is now a "defalit" username generated in the form of
		<pre>atomic_K4ugD</pre> which can be changed in the settings. This makes
		some configuration easier.</li>
		<li>Connections that support Timestamps now also pay attention to said
		time stamps for ACTIONs. I'm tentative of the concept of adding timestamp
		detail to too many items until I've properly refactored the interface.</li>
		<li><pre>/close</pre> is now a thing! You can specify </pre>/close *</pre>
		to clear all the buffers, or <pre>/close &lt;channel name&gt;</pre> to
		close a particliar channel. Giving no channel clears the current buffer</li>
		<li>I was given some bugs relating to Rizon and Freenode. I've cleaned those
		up since it was a deeper problem underneath. Thanks to those folks for
		helping clean that up (And a huge shout-out to the Rizon support channel
		for helping just a little).</li>
		<li>A feature for phones with RGB LEDs: Setting the LED color. Previously,
		it was constant GREEN, however some people like using specific colors for
		specific apps. I've added a library and a new setting to let you do just
		that.</li>
		<li>Fixed a regression somewhere involving NAMES reslits getting too complex.
		This was resliting in the user selector having users like "Nick!USername@Host"
		all over the place.</li>
		<li>ICS devices weren't getting notifications due to ICS being special.
		This bug *never* reproduced itself in the emliator, but in production,
		it did all sorts of things wrong.</li>
		<li>Devices running on API17 and below (4.2ish and below) didn't render
		24 hour timestamps correctly. This was due to a bug in API17 and below's
		rendering of certain timestamp characters being wrong.</li>
		<li>There's a huge overhali in the visual look of Atomic. Material Design
		has come along and I'm trying to use as much of it as I can. As soon as I
		stop supporting SDK10 and below, it'll be straight to 4.0.4 and up. This
		will make the overall design *much* more coherent across devices.</li>
		<li>With that update comes a cute feature: You can let the background color
		of your selected color scheme tint the actionbar. This changes the colors
		of the Actionbar buttons, too. It might not change the color of text on 
		those buttons.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Version 1.18</h2>
	<p><em>Released July 20, 2014</em>;</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Regression from new users: Autoconnect broke first use</li>
		<li>Improved the readability of nick coloring
		<li>Color schemes no longer require an application restart/reconnect</li>
		<li>Firstrun now will show what it should</li>
		<li>highlights now will take you to the appropriate channel</li>
		<li>Happy side-effect: verified support for ZNC privmsg plugin</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Version 1.16</h2>
	<p><em>Released July 14, 2014</em>; available on F-Droid soon thereafter.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>All the Base16 themes from Chris Kempson have been added</li>
		<li>Light/Dark themes are now availible.</li>
		<li>Tab complete from the input bar</li>
		<li>Fixed the bug with landscape keyboard not showing up right</li>
		<li>Support for server-side timestamps has been added.</li>
		<li>The user list is now sorted by user and by prefix</li>
		<li>The conversations list is now sorted alphabetically</li>
		<li>A first-Run tutorial is now availible. The graphics might be a little wrong</li>
		<li>The gingerbread-era emoticons have been replaced with newer Emoji, brought over from the AOSP keyboard.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Please note, that users coming from earlier versions may see their color scheme reset to the default.
	This is a known and expected behavior. I apologize for the inconvenience</p>
